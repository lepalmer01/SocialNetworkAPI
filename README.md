# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

This project involved creating an API for a social network web application that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friend list. Utilizing MongoDB for its adeptness at handling large volumes of unstructured data, this application leverages the power of the NoSQL database along with Express.js for routing and Mongoose ODM for data modeling.
